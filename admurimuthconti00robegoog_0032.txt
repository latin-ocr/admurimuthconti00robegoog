Vallum. It contains the French Bnrte chroniele (ff. 1-58),
as iu the Harley MS.. and Avcsbury's chroniele (ff.
59-104), followed by the lists of the Frenoh killed and
prisoners at Poitiers, eto, and some of the small pieoes
found on the ily-leaves in the Harley MS, vin, Nos. 2-
9 [after which sorno leaves are lost],19,16,17. 'l'he
writing is a good modium-sized hand oi the first hali ol
the 15th century, perhaps about 1430.

The MS. hears on its covers the arms oi arehbishop
Whitgift [oh. 1604], sometime Moster of Trinity.

From the fact that both D. end Τ. have certain olerical
errors in common itis evident that they were both
copied from the seme original. But the textos D.is
more carelessly written and hes more variations in the
spellings oi names than Τ. The Harlcy MS. is certainly
the archetype from which the other two MSS. were
derived, as the additions on its fly-leaves form acor-
porate part oi their text ς but it is probable that there
was an intermediate MS„ copied directly from Η., from
which D. and Τ. were transcribed.

Iwill now proceed to survey the historical informa·
tion supplied by the two chronicles printed in this
volume.

e ἕο It has aheedy been notieed how meagre is the early
232⁰ ,Ι part, or first edition, oi Murimuth's work. The first
0 ³³⁰⁶· event which is treated with less than scanty brevity is

the restoration of arohbishop Winchelsey in 1308;
and, next, the iateful career of Gaveston naturally
attrects some attention. Of the manner of his death
our chronicle has aourious version, according to which,

Ι aiter being made prisoner by the earl of Warwick and

brought to Warwick caatle‚ he was dismissed to go
whither he would, and, on leaving the town, was set
upon et Gaversike (or Blecklow hill), a mile north ol
Warwick, and beheaded. This differs from other ac·

counts end seems to have been written for the purpose
