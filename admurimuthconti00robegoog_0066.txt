“ that we had news that our lord was passed the sea
“ with his power.” Narbonae was evacuated on the
10th of November, the enemy having gathered in rear
of the English and it being necessary to meet or evade
them. The prince's letter is silent as to the first pert
of his return march. His route lay at the beginning
on a more northern line than that by which he had
approached Narbonae, but on the third day he struck
down to the south-west, and, crossing his former
route, entered the valley of the upper Aude, where he
destroyed the great city of Limoux and other places,
and then turned in a north-westerly direction towards
Toulouse, the enemy retreating before him all the while.
He did not, however, approach so near to thet city as
on his advanee, but crossed the Garonne high up the
stream, at Carbonne, on the 18th of November. Near
this place was fought a slight skirmish with the enemy
who were now threatening the rear, but who were re-
pulsed and drew away towards Lombez on the other
side of the Save, breaking down the rivers aa they crossed
over. The English passed the river lower down andiol-
lowing up their retreating foes, came up with them
near Gimont on the rand. Some fighting took place,
and the prinae drew out his forces in expectation of a
general battle ; but the enemy still refused the contest
Hereupon the English marohed on without further
molestation into their own dominions‚ reaching La Reole
on the ind, and the prince finally returning to Bordeaux
anthe tlth, of December.

Wingfield’s letter gives some further particulare. The
only person of note who perished iu the expedition
was John, lord L’Isle of Rougemont, who vves mortslly
wounded by a quar-rel (in the attaclr on Estang) on
the third day after entering hostile country, l3th
October. He mentions the destruction of Pleisanee
(loth October); Samatan is as great aa Norwieh5
Carcassonne greater, stronger, and fairer than York.
