“ Merimouth ad annum noccxav11.” This title is
founded on a memorandum which appears in the
body 01 the text 111 the middle 01 the year 1323,
preceded by tha rubric“Tractat11s magistri Adae

“de Merymouthss' thus:— “Memorandum quod ab
“ hoc loco assumitur transcriptum de tractatu rna-
“ gist ri tAdac de Merymouth, quem idem rpse oom-
“posuit de gestis Anglorum et aliis contentis post
“ cessationem fratris Nicholai Trivett, theologi de
‘¹ ordine Pradicatorum et precedentis tractatus auo·
“ toris. Sed notandum quod ipse magister Adam non
“ observat datam Nativitatis Domini aut coronationis
“ regis temporibus usitatis Ad festum sancti Michaelis
“ incipit at terminat datam anni auctor predictus.'’

The former part 01 the text however is a compilation
from 'l'rivet and Matthew of Westmimter3 and the
rest, which bears thename of Murimuth, while it follows
the ordinary version down to the siege 01 Tournay in
1340 (sae p. 114 below), irom thence begins to differ,
and has some considerable variatione which are shown
in the Appendix. It also incorporatae many documenta
relating to papal provisions and diplomatic affairs; aad
is brought down to the campaign 01 1316111 the south
of Frauce, closing with lists 01 prisonerS,places captured,
etc. It may be noticed that the compiler is very bitter
against the Scots.

11 is probabla that several leaves are lost from the
beginning3 and that a single leaf is wanting at tha end.
Thedate citha writing is probably not much later
than the middle 01 the 14111 century, aud, ii a later

marginal memorandum 0111. 1311010 great storm 01
wind ,iu lael-a was entered contemporaneously with
that event, the text must have been written before
that year.

At tha 100101 the last page is written the name
“ J ohannes da London.‚” 01 the 14th century, which may
be that 01 an owner.
