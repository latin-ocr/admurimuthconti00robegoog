O.--Ootton MS. Otho C. ii., in the British Museunr,

is one of the volumes which were partially destroyed
in the fire of 1731, and now consiste of 138 leaves and
'fragments of vellum, all more or less damaged. It
contains the “ Flores Historiarum '’ of Matthew of West-
minster, continued by a chronicle which partly agrees
with the text of Trivet and seems to have been one
of the MSS. used by Walsingham in the compilationes
his “Historia Anglicana.'' Thon follows (ff. 90-107) the
chronicle of Murimuth, corresponding in some degree
with the text of N„ but not so full and wanting the
documenta. Alter the account of the battle of Neville’s
Oross, the text falls in with the ordinary continuation,
as printed by Hall and Hog. The latter part oi the
volumeis occupied by documenta oi the years 1339-
1341; and by the anonymous chronicle of the end of
the reign of Edward IH., aa printed in the Chronicon
Aeolica in this Series. The date of the MS. is of the
latter part of the rech century.

This copy of Murimuth has been partially used in
the present edition for collation with N„ and to supply
a small part of the text in the Appendix.

In addition to the above, Ι have also made slight use
of the Harley MS. 1729, in the British Muscam, oon·
taining an imperfect copy of Higden's ‘¹ Polychronicon‚”
of the lbth century, into which is incorporated Muri·
muth's chronicle from the beginning of Edward III.'s
reign to 1339. After this year there is a gap, the text
proceeding immediately with the text of Higden from

¹ 1353. The enlargement of the personal history oi

’ bishop Grandison of Exeter and other local details
which occur in this MS. were no doubt additions origi-
nally made to some copy of Murimuth’s chronicle at
Eneter, his connection with the cathedra] church oi that
place accounting for its presence there.

Hearne has printed the portion relating to the reign
of Edward 111. at the end os his edition of Hemingford
