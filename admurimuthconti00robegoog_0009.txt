On the aeth of Ianuary 1857, the Master of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a proposal tor the publication
01 materiale for the History 01 this Oountry from the
Invasion 01 the Romans to the reign 01 Henry VIII.

The Master 01 the Rolls suggested that these materiale ,
should be selected for publication under competent
. editors without reference to periodical or chronological

arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were most scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historica] docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
ii the editor were engaged 00 00 ‘Editio Princeps3 and
ior this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation 01 the best MSS.

Το render the work more generally useful, the Master
01 the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account oi the Mus. employed by him, oi: their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a
brief account 01 the life and times of the author, end
any remarks necessary to explain the chronology; but
00 other note or comment was to be allowed, except
what might be necessary to establish the correctness 01

the text.
