advantageous position and that they fought a strictly
defensive battle, in which the volleys of their archers
did so much to break the force of the attacks before the
enemy could come to close quarters, it is no -matter for

With regard to the special list of persons ol rank
who fell on the French side, it is not very easy to correct
the errors which appear therein-some evidently the
result of imperfect information gathered by the officere
appointed to examine the bodies on the field; some the

ol Sans, who was certainly not slain. Wynkeley also
adds another archbishop, namo unknown, whom the
Appendix calls bishop, and N orthburgh, archbishop‚ oi
