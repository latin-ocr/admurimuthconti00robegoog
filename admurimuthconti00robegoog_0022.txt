Franco and ol the different negotiatione in connection
with them. Murirnuth's position in the church of St.
Paul's gave him access to documenta and private infor-
mation of which he has here freely availed himself.

impp The chronicle was first edited hy Anthony Hall,
together with the continuatius of the annals of Nicholas
Trivet and the “Speculum Ooenobitarurn'’ of John
Boston, in a volume which he published at Oxford in
1722. He made uso cf the MS. :304 in Queen's
College (described below) as tho basis of his text, col-
lating the copy in Magdalen MS. 53 (see below) and
another MS. which was in possession of the carl ol
Cerdigan. This edition, however, gave only the first
version of the chronicle, brought down to Michaelmas
1337; hut was supplemented hy e continuation to
1380, also found in the Quaen's MS. This contiuua-
tion‚ as it is in no way the work cf Murimuth, we
need not stay to examine.

In 1846 a new edition was attempted by Μ r. Thomas
Hog for the English Historieal Society. Making use
of the various MSS. of Murimuth in the British Muscam,
Mr. Hog compiled from them a text to the year 13463
at lhe end of which he reprinted the continuation to
1380 already published by Hall. But, although he had
thus under his hands the material for a perfect edition
of the chronicle, by some strange oversight he neg-
lected tc make full use of the one MS. which contains
the text in its most complete form. He appears to
have been content to collate the Harlcy MS. 3836
only as far as the place in the year 1337 where Hall's
text ends, although in his preface he recognizes the
velue of the MS. and its extent.
