the siege of Auberoche by the French under Louia de
Poitiers, comte de Valentinois (whom both Murimuth
and Avesbury divide into two persone, apparently eon-

title of Ponte Acuto or Pontagu), and Bertrand‚ comte
de L'Isle-Jourdain Here Derby‚ or rather, as he should
now be called, Lancaster (to which title he had sue·
needed on the nand of September), came upon them on
the alst of October; and a great battle was fought,
which ended in the total defeat of the French, the death
of Valentinois (erroneously numbered among the pri-
sonem), and the capture of L’Isle-Jourdain. Lista of the
principal prisoners appear in two of the MSS. (pp. 249,
251).

Lancaeter’s conquesta during the rest of the year
1345 and early in 1346 are not followed in our chron-
icles, excepting that his capture of Aiguillon is briefly
noticed in one place (p. 249). This important city,
ae well as La Reolc, was in hie hands before the end
of the year, and his operatione then extended along
the course of the Lot end the lower Garonne. In one
MS. (p. 251) we have a liat of places captured by him
in the course of his' expeditione, much confused and not
always easily identified, but, as far aa ean be done,
referred to by their correct names in tha Index.
