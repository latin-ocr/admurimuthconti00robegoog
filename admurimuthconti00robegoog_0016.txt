Adam appears to have belonged to a family 01 111
name 01 Murimuth‚ which was settled at Fifield in
Oxfordshire. He was no doubt edueated at Oxford3 and
it is as proctor for his university in a suit at the court
of Rome against the Black Friars, in 1311, that hc first
appears before us. He was at this period a doctor of
civil law and in his 3611 or 37th year. Ι1 111 middle ¹
of the next year, as he himself records (p. 18), he was ’
again despatched to Avignon 10 represent arohbishop .
Winchelsey in his quarrel with bishop Langton of
Ooventry, who had appealed to the pope against the l
sentence of excommunication passed 01 him by his ¹
metropolitan. “ That he was employed by Reynolds

mentioned mission ; at all events, at the close 011316
11 11 still found at Arignon, being addressed, along
with others, in royal letters which announced the
