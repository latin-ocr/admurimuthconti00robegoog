enemy also abandoned a stronghold, called by Murimuth
Goule Foreste,¹ which was at once garrisoned by the
English. This place may be identified with La Fordt
between Brest and Landerneau‚ and seems to be quite
different from the Gai-la-Fordt which was captured,
according to Froissart, about the same time by sir
Walter Manny, and which was probably near
Hennebon. ’
Northampton next advanced on MorlaiX, which he
attempted to capture by assault, but was beaten off
' with loss. He had better fortune in a battle which
immediately followed with Oharles of Blois who had
hastened to the relief of the town. The French were
totally defeated on the 30th of September with severe
loss, and among the prisonem was Geoffroi de Oharny.
Murimuth describes this battle twice over, the first
account (p. 127) being fuller and evidently intended to
supersede the other (p. 128). Northamptou's subse·
quent movernents are not given 3 and, indeed, his share
in the events of the campaign are involved in some
obscurity. His victory at Morlnix has been elsewhere
assigned tc Robert of Artoia2 who, there is reason to
believe, was present with him and probably held an
independent command. Baker of Swynebroke describes
it as one of the lrardest fought actions of Edward's
reign. But, although victorious, Northampton was
forced to retreat and no doubt fell back on Brest, where
¹ the king landed at the end of October, having sailed
from Portsmouth on the nard of the month. The letter neman
which Edward wrote to his son on the 5th of December, “mmm
as given by Avesbury , does not enter into the details
of the early part of his operatione beyond noticing the
capture of the three towns of Ploe'rmel, Malestroit, and
aedon, in the course of a great raid. Other mcounts
