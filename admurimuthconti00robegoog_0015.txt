Aur that can be traced 01 the lile 01 Adam 1101110011]1111)ήεῖ11ιήιι
has been already investigated by the Bishop 01 Oxsord ’
and described in his Introduction to the Chronicles os aa
Reipne of Edward Laud Edwcrd II. (vol. i.‚ pp. lx.
sqq.) in this Series. In following the path thus made
smooth l'or me,I have little more to do than to mark
the confirmation which the Bishop’s suggestions regard·.

- ing the period 01 our writer’s lile receive from the
complete chronicle now first printed in this volume

Murimnth was born between Michaelmas, 1274, and

Michaelmas, 1275. The year 01 his death was 1347.
Under nine successive years in his chronicle, from 1338
to 1346110 gives his own age, and, although some con-
fusion is caused hy an omission and repetition hythe
carelessness 01 the scribe, the numbers come right in the
end. At Michaelmas 1338 (p. 87) he states that he was
in his 6411] year3 in 1339 (p. 102), in his 65th year.
Under 1340 and the fou'r following years (pp. 110120,
128147, 159) the reckoning is wrong, being 'written as
his 67th to 71st‚ instead 01 his 66th to 70111, years ;, but
under 1345 (p. 176) the true order is restored, and he
appears as in his 71st year ; and finally in 1346 (p. 218)
as in his 7206 year.

Ι The last event recorded in his chronicle took place at
the beginning 01 1347; and in that year the rectory
01 Wraysbury in Buckinghamshire which he held was
given to his successor, John de Melton, who was insti-
tuted on the aoth 01 June. These facts seem to afford
pretty conclusive procl that Murimuth died in the first
