in 1320, made bishop of Lincoln by his uncle's influente,
who spent more than 15,000t. of public money with
no return but this promotion of his nephew, who,
alter all, shewed anything but gratitudo to his king.
Robert Wyville, who in 1330 became bishop of Salis·
bury, was, like de Beaumont‚ illiterata and ill-favoured
withal, and again, like the other, would hardly have
attained to suob high rank had the pope first set eyes
on him. And three years later the chapter of Canter-
bury had perfores to makea virtue oi necessity in
electing John Stratiord, a man in favour with both
king and pope. But the most interesting instante of
these personal remarks is that in which Richard Bury,
bishop of Durham, who died in 1345, is represented
as one who got promotion by the interest oi great
people and by the “ambitionis vitium,’' who, thus
forced to live beyond his means, died in object poverty
and, posing as a great scholar though scantly furnished
with learning, managed to get together by gift, loan
orpurcbase his more than five great cart-loads oi books.
His successor too comes in for a bad word. The
chapter of Durham had to elect Thomas Hatfield with
more unanimity than cheerlulness, and sang Te Deum
with the voice of mourning.
