Ἕω, Aveshury briefly reeords the capture of the oity of
lffils, mPerigueux for the English hythe captel de Buch3 the
mse ’revolt at Arrss against the levy ol the gebelle; and
Edward’s refusal to send envoys, at the pope’s request,

for further pesoe negotiations3 and then proceedsto
the account of the treacherous seizure oi the king of
Navarre and the oomte de Heroourt and the consequent
expeditiones the duke of Lancester into Normandy in

Sending over before him the mein part of his force,
the duke landed at LaHougue on the 18th oi June,
1356, and four days later, starting from Montebourg,
he set out on a long reid, oi which Aveshnry supplies

Torigni3 thence eastward through Evreoy, Argenees,
and Lisieux to Ponthudemer, where he arrived on the

astill longer march to Torigni3 and at length, efter
a slight skirmish‚ arrived again at Montebourg on the
l3th. .
With this expedition Avesbury's chroniele practieally

and ol prisoners attho previous skirmish at Le Chabo-
terie end at the still earlier assault ol Remorantin
ere a part oi it, or, as seems more probahle, are merely

the nature of things, inexact and eoniused: hlunders
