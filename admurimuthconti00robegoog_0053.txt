On the day of St. Bartholomew (Thursday, asch August)
the English army reached the Somme and prepared to
effect a passage near SaintValery. To oppose them,
there was posted on the opposite bank a strong body cf
the enemy: Wynkeley says a thousand horse and five
thousand foot, or more3 Northburgh, five hundred horse
