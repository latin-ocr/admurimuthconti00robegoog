had previously despatched the duke of Narmandy
against them, a movement which brought on the battle
of casselin which the Flemings, with the aid of a body
of English archers, maintained their ground. Avesbury,
it may be noticed, dates this battle as early as the 8th
of June. The French army under Philip at last drew
near to Calais on the 27111 01 July3 and we have a
narrative of the next events in Edwards own letter to
archbishop Stratiord After some skirmishing Philip
pitched his camp on high ground, separated from the
English lines by marshy land which was traversed by a ,
oauseway held by the earl 01 Lancaster. The two car·
1111010, Annibale Oeccano and Etienne Aubert, had ao·
companicd the relieving army and now attempted
mediation. Negotiations were opened, but after 10111
days no result was arrived at; and then followed a
challenge 10 battle from the French. But again this
came to nothing, the terma of comhat could not be
arranged; and on Thursday, the 2nd of August, Philip
suddenly retreated, leaving his camp in flames. Calais
immediately surrendered, Avesbury says on the 3111, but
actually on the 4th‚ of August; and on the 28111 01
September a truce to last till midsummer following was
concluded by the persist tent efforts of the two cardi·
nals.
