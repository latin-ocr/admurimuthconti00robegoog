01 explaining why Gaveston was removed outsidc the
walls for execution. The Aauutcc Loradooc'cusas1 report
that this step was taken in order to ploce the prisoner
beyond the earl's jurisdiction, an'd describe the refusal
01 the latter to allow the body to be brought into the·
town afterwards. Among the great historiual events
of the time, the battle 01 Bannockburn is dismissed
iu a single sentenoe; Edward’s campaign against the
rebel barons in 1321 and 1322, culminatiug in his
victory at Boroughbridge and his vongeance on his
enemim, is treated at better length3 and queen Isabella's

¹ invasion and the king’s abdication and subsequent'

murder receive comparatively 0 1011 notice, without,
however, adding anything material to other accounts.
One small point may be noticed 00 an indication that
Murimutb gave some attention to details in revising hia
work 101 10101 editions In the MSS. 01 the earlier
types, Goumay, the murderer 01 Edward 11, is said to
have been captured at Mauseides, whereas it is known
that he was first taken at Burgos, and, 01101 an escape,
again at Naples. Murimutb became aware of his error
and altered his “apud Marcilium ’' into ‘¹ in partibus
“ transmarinis ’'; but he still remains the authority for
the 10100 statement that Gournay was beheaded at sea,
in order to screen certain great persons who might have
been accused by him. Goumay died at Bayonne on his
way 10 England, aad his body was brought home, the
ship arriving at Berwick, which Edward III. was then
besieging‚ early in July 1333. It is, however, not im-
possible that Goumay’s body was actually beheaded and
gibbeted, and that hence Murimutb derived his story.
'l'he brief account 01 the execution 01 Edmund 01
Woodstock, carl of Kent, on the charge of conspiracy
to restore his brother, king Edward, supposed to be still
living, is supplemented by the French' text 01 the
