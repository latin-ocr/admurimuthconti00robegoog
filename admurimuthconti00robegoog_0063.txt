his daughter) aa lroetages. Oharles set out after Errster
and remained in Brittany till about Michaelmas. It
was at the period 01 ¹hie return, according to our chron-
icler, that the treacheroue massacre 01 an English garrison
in an island off the Breton coast caused negotiatione 10
be abruptly broken off. But by other accounts it appears
that the island in question, which was 110 doubt the isle
of Tristan near the bay 01 Douarnenez, was taken by
Charles in person soon after his arrival in the country.l
The negotiatione, however, appear to have been pro·
tracted longer than hvesbury implies; 101 on the 20111Ι
01 November an order was issued 101 publication 01 a
truce to last till the following February, and Charles 01
Blois was again in Brittany in the course 01 the year
1354. Avesbury’s story that sir Walter Bentley suffered
imprisonment in the 'l'ower for· more than a year for
refusing to surrender certain strongholds in Brittany to

the partisans of Charles of Blois is supported by the
miesion to that country, on the l8th 01 J uly, 1353, of
an officer to remonstratc with those captains who refused
to obey the king's new lieutenant, sir John Avenel,

appointed in April.2 He must, however, have been
released before J uly, 1354, as at that date the king made

a grant in his favour.³

In 1354, by 1110 efforts of Clamant vl, negotiatione rae ,

101 peace were again opened in the spring, the former ”mmm
truce having expired; and on the 6111 01 April a further
truce was concluded 101 a year, on the understanding
that both eides should send envoys to treet 101 a per-
manent settlement in presence 01 the pope. Towards
the close 01 the year the meeting took place at Avi·
gnon ; but the envoys entirely failed 10 arrlve etan
