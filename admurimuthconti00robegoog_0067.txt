The destruction and loss to the French wrought in
this raid he reckons as equal bo the war-service of
half the kingdom.

There is nothing in the letters to show whence
Avesbury could have drawn his account of panio at
Montpellier and Avignon, and, what is of more impor-
tance, his story of the severe defeat of the pope¹s forces
under command ol his marshal who was made prisoner.
This fable may possibly have arisen out of the pre-
sence and detention of the pope’s sergeant-atarms
with the English force, as described by Wingfield;
although it seems difficult to believe that so much
could have grown out of so trifling an incident.

Sir Richard Stafford and sir William Burton were
the bearers of these despatches3 which are followed by
another letter from Wingfield to Stallord, written from
Libourne in the following J anuary. In this the writer
announces the capture of five important towns and
seventeen castles and is full of general activity ori
the English side. To these successes Avesbury addsa
note of others which immediately followed.

As we have seen, Edward returned from Calais on amptum
the report of the surprise of Berwick by the Scots on⁰¹¹³m¹⁰k¹
'the 6th of November, 1355. But, though they had
gained possession of the town, the castle still remained

in the hands of the English ganison. After holding
a parliament in London‚ Edward advanced into the
north and appeared before the captured town on the
13th of ,Ianuary, 1³56. Sir Walter Manny had pre-
ceded him, and with abody of men from the forest of
Dean was already undermining the walle, to find a
passage into the place. The Scots surrendered on the
alth. This exploit was followed by Edward Bruce's
abandonment of his crown, and by Edward’s imme·
diate invasion of Scotland and his fruitless campaign
which ended in the loss of his victualling ships and his
consequent retirement into England.
