April. This aetion was brought ou inan attempt by

' an Angla-Gascou force to relieve the town 01 saint-dean·
d’Angely to which the French had laid siege. The
enemy were defeated, but the victory was not suffici·
eutly decisive to force 1110 besiegers to relinquish their
hold of the place, which at length fell on the 711101
September, 1351.

The curicus story 01 the surprise of Guines castlc, at
the beginning 01 1352, by an English adventurer, which
is told very fully by Baker, is dismissed in ufcw

1100001 sentences by Avesbury, who pasees on to the defeat

ll‘ul'llil of the French ct Macron, iu Brittany, by Dagworth’s
successor, sir Walter Bentley, on the 4111 01 August.
From Bentley’s own despatch, addressed to 1110011011-
ccllor, bishop Thoresby, of Worcester, it appears that the
English captain had, on his arrival in Brittany, com·
menced operatione by placing Plotrmcl and Fougtres
in a state of defencc, when he was suddenly surprised
by the enemy in far superior numbers at Macron, near
the former town. The battle was fought on open ground
and resulted disastrously 101 the French, whose leader,
the marshal (101 de Neslc, sire d’Offemont, fell together
with many others. Bentley is more eager to 101101 the
slain than 01 1110 mcvements 01 the conflict. Baker 01
Swyuebrokc enters more into detail: that the enemy
fought with their backs to a hill, that many knights 01
the newly·lounded order of the Star were left dead upon
the field, and that Bentley himself was severely wounded
and that in his anger he beheaded thirty 01 his own
archers who had shown cowardice before the enemy.

In the following year, 1353, serious efforts were made
101 tharansem 01 Charles of Blois‚ still aprisoner in

¹³ England. Envoys were despatched to this country, and
it was finally arranged that Charles's eldcst son, John,
should espouse Margaret, 1110 infant daughter 01 the
English king, and that Charles himself should visit

Brittauy on parole, iu order to raiae a sufficient sum 101
